In the chance I get an interview I wanted to make a mock protoype of a mempool redis stream. I imagine your architecture is much more complex but wanted to get into the headspace of some of the problems your architecture deals with. Also I realize your products have a heavy API/SDK component as well which I have some experience with on my PayLater Project (add link). 

I was already about to try and participate in the madella eth2 testnet so i figured why not just take my node and do this with it. (Its running on an ec2 instance)

Also I am interested in how Blocknative will approach the coming Roll Up dominant + eth2.0 landscape. It seems Eth2.0 wont fundementally disrupt mempool analysis but ZK roll ups could make analysis much harder. I think the switch to Optimistic execution will only increase the desire for your services.
